Now that you've understood the basics of cybersecurity and explored key threats, let's move to the next topic.

Step 2: Basic Terminology in Cybersecurity


Key Knowledge:
In cybersecurity, understanding common terms and concepts is essential. Here are some important ones youâ€™ll encounter frequently:

Threats: Anything that can cause potential harm to systems or data. Examples include malware, hackers, and even natural disasters.

Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in a system that can be exploited by a threat. For example, an unpatched software bug that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access.

Exploits: Specific methods or tools used to take advantage of vulnerabilities. For example, using a script that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in a program.

Firewall: A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls help block unauthorized access to or from private networks.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):

  IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.
  IPS goes one step further by blocking or preventing detected threats.

Encryption: The process of converting data into a coded format to protect it from unauthorized access. Only those with the right decryption key can read the data.

Common Network Protocols:

  TCP/IP: The foundational protocol of the internet, which governs how data is transmitted over networks.
  HTTP and HTTPS: Protocols used to transmit data between a web browser and a website (HTTPS is encrypted).
  DNS: The system that translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.


Task:
Choose three terms from the list above (or any other common cybersecurity term you're curious about) and research their practical use or real-world examples.
For example:

Firewall: Find out how firewalls are used in home routers or enterprise networks to block malicious traffic.
Encryption: Explore how encryption protects your data when you shop online or use messaging apps like WhatsApp.
