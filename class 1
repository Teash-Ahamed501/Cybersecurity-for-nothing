Step 1: Understanding Cybersecurity
Key Knowledge:
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. The main goal 
of cybersecurity is to ensure the CIA Triad:

Confidentiality: Keeping sensitive data hidden from unauthorized users.
Integrity: Ensuring data is accurate and has not been tampered with.
Availability: Making sure systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
Cybersecurity involves both offensive security (ethical hacking) and defensive security (protecting systems). Cybersecurity 
professionals defend against a variety of threats, which can range from malicious software (malware) to more sophisticated 
attacks like social engineering or phishing.


Task:
Research the following three common cyber threats and provide real-world examples for each:

Malware: Programs designed to damage or disrupt systems.
Phishing: An attempt to trick people into revealing sensitive information.
Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals to breach security by deceiving them.
Take your time, and feel free to ask any questions if needed. Let me know when you're done!


What is difference between Social Engineering and phishing?

-----
Social Engineering:
Social engineering is a broader category of attacks where hackers manipulate or trick people into giving up confidential 
information or performing actions that compromise security. The key idea is exploiting human psychology rather than directly 
attacking systems. Social engineering attacks can take many forms, such as:

Impersonation: Pretending to be someone trustworthy (e.g., a tech support employee) to get sensitive information.
Baiting: Leaving a USB drive loaded with malware in a public place, hoping someone will pick it up and plug it into their 
computer.

-----
Phishing:
Phishing is a specific type of social engineering attack. It usually involves sending fake emails, messages, or websites 
that appear to be from legitimate sources (like a bank or company) to trick people into providing sensitive information 
like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details.

Phishing typically uses email, SMS, or websites to steal information.
An example of phishing would be an email that looks like itâ€™s from PayPal, asking you to "verify your account" and leading 
you to a fake website where you enter your login details.

----
Difference:
Scope: Social engineering is a broad category that includes many types of psychological manipulation (including 
phishing). Phishing is one specific tactic under that umbrella.

Method: Phishing often relies on electronic communication (emails, websites, etc.), while social engineering can 
involve face-to-face interactions or other non-digital methods like phone calls.
